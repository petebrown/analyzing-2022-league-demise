# analyzing-2022-league-demise
 This repo contains a simple analysis of Tranmere's post-February collapse in the 2021/22 season.

 My goal for this project was to work on my Datawrapper -> Illustrator workflow and produce some small multiples.

A Jupyter notebook containing my data wrangling, analysis and process can be found [here](https://github.com/petebrown/analyzing-2022-league-demise/blob/main/notebook/analyzing-2022-league-demise.ipynb)
